## ---> What is anomaly detection?

Anomaly detection (aka outlier analysis) is a step in data mining that identifies data points, events, and/or observations that deviate from a datasetâ€™s normal behavior. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as a technical glitch, or potential opportunities, for instance a change in consumer behavior. Machine learning is progressively being used to automate anomaly detection.


## Autoencoder-based anomaly detection

Autoencoder-based anomaly detection is to perform anomaly detection by compressing normal data into a latent space of a smaller dimension than the original data through the autoencoder, then restoring it and comparing the difference between the restored data and the original data. The part that encodes the normal data to the lower dimension is called the encoder, and the part that decodes the compressed sample back to the original dimension is called the decoder. The data expression in the latent space where the data is compressed by the encoder is called a latent variable. The autoencoder learns through the process of minimizing the difference between the original data and the restored data, and in the process, the features of the learning data are naturally extracted to construct a latent space.

The specific way an autoencoder compares the input and output differences also determines the performance and characteristics of anomaly detection. The most basic method considers the original data and the restored data as points in the n-dimensional coordinate space, and uses the distance between the two points as an index of the input/output difference. This metric is called the reconstruction error. Since the autoencoder used for anomaly detection is trained to restore normal data well, compression and restoration cannot be performed effectively when abnormal data is input. Therefore, the abnormal data has a large restoration error.
The restoration error can be used as one of the anomaly scores that indicate the degree of anomaly of a given data. If the anomaly score is greater than a predetermined threshold, the data is considered anomaly, and if it is small, it is considered normal. Thresholds are set differently depending on the specific characteristics and requirements of the anomaly detection you want to perform.

The auto encoder learns to produce the same output as the input as much as possible. Through this learning process, the representation of the input can be effectively compressed in the latent space. In other words, it compresses the dimensions and stores the representation of the input in the latent space.
